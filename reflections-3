1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> So that I can have the working version of my project in the remote and can experiment with the changes on my local repo.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--> Manually pulling changes lets you get updated with changes wich only you want to update to.

3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

--> Branches are a part of your project that are different from your main version. You use branches when you want to work on a feature of your project but just dont want to include it in your main version.
Clones are copies of your repositories within your local machine or between a local machine and github.
Forks are copies of repositories on github.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

--> By having a copy of the last known state of the remote locally we can compare changes to our local file with the files in our remote.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

--> Collaboration can be done by comparing our two local files and adding changes.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

--> When we do not want  our new features to affect the main work in master branch.

1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> So that I can have the working version of my project in the remote and can experiment with the changes on my local repo.

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--> Manually pulling changes lets you get updated with changes wich only you want to update to.
